# Logistic-Regression

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Logistic Regression machine learning model using Python. The objective is to perform binary classification by modeling the probability of a categorical outcome based on one or more independent variables.

The project follows a complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results. It is designed for learning as well as practical understanding of classification problems.
